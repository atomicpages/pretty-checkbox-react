## Development Process

Pretty Checkbox React uses github as its source of truth and all changes are
public from the beginning :+1. When a change is made, github actions will lint,
build, and test Pretty Checkbox React code.

### Branch Organization

Pretty Checkbox React has one main branch: `master`. This is where the code
lives and development takes place. For the most part, `master` will stay in good
shape.
