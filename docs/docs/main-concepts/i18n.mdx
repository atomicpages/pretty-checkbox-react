PCR doesn't contain any locale-specific strings that are rendered in the browser. Since you, the super awesome user of PCR, provides all the content, it seamlessly integrates into your i18n/l10n/g11n solution :smile:

## RTL Usage

PCR RTL usage requires no extra config for support; however, you **do** need to import one extra file from `@djthomps/pretty-checkbox`:

```js title="index.js"
import '@djthoms/pretty-checkbox/src/pretty-checkbox.scss';
import '@djthoms/pretty-checkbox/src/rtl.scss';
```

In the example, below we're using the `direction` property to achiev RTL direction,
but in most cases you'd add the `dir` attribute to the `html` tag directly.

```jsx live
<div style={{ direction: 'rtl' }}>
    <Checkbox>مرحبا</Checkbox>
</div>
```
