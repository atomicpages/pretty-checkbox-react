:::note
Animations overrides are applicable to `Checkbox` and `Radio` only

In terms of basic concepts we're at the end of the road folks. We've learned a lot about what PCR can do, now it's time to explore the crown jewel of the library: animations.

Animations are broken into two categories:

1. Animations that **only** work with images
1. Animations that work without images as well (i.e. universal animations)

Possible values: `smooth`, `pulse`, `tada`, `jelly`, and `rotate`.

## Universal Animations

Universal, or basic, animations work with all configurations of `Checkbox` and `Radio` (including with icons). Out of the list of five, there are **two** that can be used universally:

-   `smooth`
-   `pulse`

```jsx live
<>
    <Checkbox animation="smooth">Smooth</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox animation="pulse" color="info-o">
        Pulse
    </Checkbox>
</>
```

## Icon Animations

Icons animations are intended to be used when the [`icon` prop](icons) is defined. There are three _new_ animations that can be used:

-   `tada`
-   `jelly`
-   `rotate`

```jsx live
<>
    <Checkbox animation="tada" icon={<i className="mdi mdi-check" />}>
        Tada
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox animation="jelly" color="danger" icon={<i className="mdi mdi-bug" />}>
        Jelly
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox animation="rotate" plain icon={<i className="mdi mdi-close" />}>
        Rotate
    </Checkbox>
</>
```
